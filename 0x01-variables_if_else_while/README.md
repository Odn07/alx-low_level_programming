##0-positive_or_negative.c: 

This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

    You can find the source code here
    The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
    You donâ€™t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
    The output of the program should be:
        The number, followed by
            if the number is greater than 0: is positive
            if the number is 0: is zero
            if the number is less than 0: is negative
        followed by a new line
