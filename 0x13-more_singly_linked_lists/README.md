##0x13. C - More singly linked lists

#Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

#General

1. How to use linked lists
2. Start to look for the right source of information without too much help

# Requirements

#General

1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
3. All your files should end with a new line
4. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
5. Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
6. You are not allowed to use global variables
7. No more than 5 functions per file
8. The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
9. You are allowed to use _putchar
10. You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
11. The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called lists.h
12. Don’t forget to push your header file
13. All your header files should be include guarded

1. TASKS 0: A function that prints all the elements of a listint_t list
2. TASKS 1: A function that returns the number of elements in a linked listint_t list
3. TASKS 2: A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint_t list
4. TASKS 3: A function that adds a new node at the end of a listint_t list
5. TASKS 4: A function that frees a listint_t list.
6. TASKS 5: A function that frees a listint_t list
7. TASKS 6: A function that deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list, and returns the head node’s data (n)
8. TASKS 7: A function that returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list.
9. TASKS 8: A function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list
10. TASKS 9: A function that inserts a new node at a given position.
11. TASKS 10: A  function that deletes the node at index index of a listint_t linked list.
12. TASKS 11: A
