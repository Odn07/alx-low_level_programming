##0x08. C - Recursion

#Learning Objectives:

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

#General

1. What is recursion
2. How to implement recursion
3. In what situations you should implement recursion
4. In what situations you shouldn’t implement recursion

#Requirements:

#General

1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werro    r -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
3. All your files should end with a new line
4. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
5. Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.p    l
6. You are not allowed to use global variables
7. No more than 5 functions per file
8. You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc…     is forbidden
9. You are allowed to use _putchar
10. The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be in    cluded in your header file called main.h
11. You are not allowed to use any king of loop.
12. You are not allowed to use static variables.

1. TASKS 0: A function that prints a string, followed by a new line. Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s).
2. TASKS 1: A function that prints a string in reverse. Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s).
3. TASKS 2: A function that returns the length of a string. Prototype: int _strlen_recursion(char *s).
4. TASKS 3: A function that returns the factorial of a given number. Prototype: int factorial(int n); If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error. Factorial of 0 is 1
5. TASKS 4: A function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y. Prototype: int _pow_recursion(int x, int y); If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1.
6. TASKS 5: A function that returns the natural square root of a number. Prototype: int _sqrt_recursion(int n); If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1.
7. TASKS 6: A function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
8. TASKS 7: A 

    Prototype: int is_prime_number(int n)
