##0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

#Learning Objectives:

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

#General

1. What are pointers and how to use them
2. What are arrays and how to use them
3. What are the differences between pointers and arrays
4. How to use strings and how to manipulate them
5. Scope of variables

#Requirements:

#General

1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
3. All files should end with a new line
4. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
5. Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
6. Use global variables not allowed.
7. No more than 5 functions per file
8. Not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is forbidden
9. Use _putchar
10. Use the main.c files to test your functions.
11. All functions prototypes should be included in a header file main.h.

TASKS 0: Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
TASKS 1: Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.
TASKS 2: Write a function that returns the length of a string.
TASKS 3. Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
TASKS 4: Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
TASKS 5: Write a function that reverses a string. 
TASKS 6: Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
TASKS 7: Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line. The function should print the second half of the string. If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2
TASKS 8: Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line. where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed. Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space. The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array. You are allowed to use printf.
